 <h1>Burj Kalifa</h1>
 <p>The architectural height of Burj Khalifa is 828 meters or 2717 feet, this is measured to the top of the spire, as its spire is considered an architectural element of the tower.
Before 2010, Burj Khalifa's height has long been kept as a secret in order to prevent it from being surpassed by potential competitors. Finally the owner Emaar claimed the standard height of Burj Khalifa to be 828 meters, with a total height of 829.8 meters to its tip (there's a 1.7 meter small needle atop the top of spire at 828 meters), making it the tallest building in the world in any categories. As of 2019, Burj Khalifa has been holding the crown of World's Tallest Building for 10 years.</p>

 <h1>Maldives</h1>
 <p>The Maldives are the stuff dreams are made of - as in dream vacations inspired by those impossibly perfect pictures you've seen, or those pesky fantasies about quitting your day job to live on an exotic island for the rest of your life. You know, the places that can't possibly live up to your expectations of beauty and wonder. Well, we found out that the Maldives actually does live up to every single expectation. It looks exactly like those stock images floating across your screen: bright sun, transparent blue lagoons, house reefs teeming with fish, low waters with baby reef sharks and rays, and white sand beaches that stretch out into nothing but miles and miles of turquoise waters and blue skies.</p>

 <h1>Iguazu Waterfalls</h1>
 <p>There is a legend that explains how the falls were created. A god was to marry Naipi, a beautiful woman. This woman canoed away with her lover, angering the god. The god was enraged and sliced the river, which not only created the falls but condemned the two lovers to fall for eternity.
 The falls are 1.7 miles long, divided by islands along its edge. These falls range from 197 to 269 feet high. The average height of most of the falls is 210 feet.
The actual number of waterfalls fluctuates depending on the water level and how much water is flowing. The number ranges from 150 to 300 falls at any given time.
Three cities in three countries, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, have access to Iguazu River.</p>

 <h1>Taj Mahal</h1>

It takes a pinkish hue in the morning, milky white in the evening and golden at night when illuminated by moonlight.It intricate work of art and architectural genius took 17 years to complete.The most recognizable feature is the white dome at the peak of the mausoleum.

 <h1>Palm Jumairah</h1>
 <p>Instead of concrete slabs, the foundations of The Palm were created from 7 million tons of rock blasted from the nearby Hajar Mountains. And while the desert emirate is surrounded by sand, 120 million cubic metres of the stuff were dredged from the bottom of the sea to form the island. In fact, the amount of rock and sand used in Palm Jumeirah’s construction could form a 2m-wide wall that would circle the globe three times. 
 The crescent-shaped breakwater was the first section of The Palm to be built. It protects the inner island from strong sea currents and the seasonal ‘shamal’ winds that blow across the Gulf from Iraq. A geotextile membrane, which stops the sand from washing away, was topped by a layer of one-ton rocks, followed by two more layers of rocks weighing up to six tons each.

 <h1>Giza Pyramids</h1>
 <p> While the three pyramids of the Giza plateau – known as Cheops (The Great Pyramid), Chephren and Mycerinus are the most famous in Egypt, more than 130 other pyramids have been discovered scattered around the area of Ancient Egypt.The Pyramids of Giza are the oldest and sole remaining intact wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This list also once included the Lighthouse of Alexandria, Colossus of Rhodes and Statue of Zeus at Olympia – which no longer exist today, plus the scattered remains of the Temple of Artemis in Turkey. Historians estimate that over 100,000 people were involved in the construction of the Pyramids of Giza, and that they may not have been slaves as once thought but rather paid workers.</p>
