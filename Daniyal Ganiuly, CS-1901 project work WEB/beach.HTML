		<div><h1>THE MALDIVES</h1>
			<p>
			With some of the world’s most pristine and secluded beaches and many spectacular bays, this tropical island paradise is certainly a honeymoon hotspot. If you like your hotels to be on the luxurious side, we have several to choose from here. The snorkelling is excellent and the lush vegetation covering the island is teeming with wildlife and rare species. If you get fed up with one stretch of picture-perfect beach - although we doubt you will - you can simply find another.Paradise awaits you… If your idea of paradise is a pristine tropical island with swaying palm trees and pure white beaches surrounded by crystalline lagoons of varying shades of blue – then the Maldives Islands will definitely fit the bill.
			Indeed, it is not without reason that the Maldives has been described as ‘(the) flower of the Indies’ by Marco Polo and ‘one of the wonders of the world’ by Ibn Batuta.</p></div>

			<h1>AGADIR, MOROCCO</h1>
			<p>Like Hurghada, Agadir is a lovely coastal resort, often considered to be the most popular in all of Morocco. The city is modern, stylish and beautiful - but it’s the beach and year-round sunshine that is the real draw. Life here seems to revolve around the enormous, clean beach. Enjoy typical activities such as paddling in the shallows, sunbathing and heading to a local cafe for a treat. If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, make sure you try out everything from jet skiing and quad biking to riding dune buggies, horses and even camels.</p>

			<h1>BARCELONA, SPAIN</h1>
			<p>There are four main beach areas in Barcelona, all of which are sandy, golden slices of Spanish heaven. Our favourite is Barceloneta. It’s closest to the city centre, which is great for convenience, but also means it tends to get the busiest. Here you can windsurf, kitesurf, swim, get refreshments from one of the many beach huts or just read a book in the warm sun. What could be better?</p>

			<h1>CARIBBEANS, LATIN AMERICA</h1>
			<p>When it comes to beach holiday destinations, Carrebean Islands is always a top choice - and for good reason. Whether you want to relax on your resort’s beach or explore a selection of other sandy spots around the city, you’ll be spoiled for choice. When you’re not splashing in the warm waves or catching a tan, you can immerse yourself in everything from diving, snorkelling and other water sports to sipping a drink at a beachside bar, strolling down the shore and collecting seashells.</p>
