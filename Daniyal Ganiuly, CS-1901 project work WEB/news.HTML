		<h2>The trendy Tokyo suburbs where two worlds collide</h2>	
		<p>Tokyo is a city that’s constantly evolving - from new skyscrapers reshaping its skyline to the youth culture trends influencing fashion and music.
		But it’s also a city where modernity and tradition co-exist.
		Although only minutes away, the neighbourhoods of Shibuya and Shimokitazawa are good examples.
		Shibuya is a hub of fashion and youth pop-culture, filled with mesmerising neon billboards, while Shimokitazawa has kept its unique identity and is known for its vintage shops and bohemian feel.

			<h2>A guide to Hatta, Dubai</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Hatta, where a rugged, mountainous landscape, cooler climate and abundant outdoor adventure activities await. This is an inland exclave of Dubai, about 130 kilometres south east of the main city boundaries, sitting on the border with Oman by the beautiful Hajar Mountains.
			Hatta formerly belonged to Oman, but in 1850 was given to Dubai. Despite this, it still has more in common with the laidback Omani lifestyle than the fast-paced routines the emirate’s residents are used to. Today, although many people do live in Hatta, it is best known as a family-friendly weekend escape.</p></div>

			<h2>Dubai’s top tours</h2>
			<p>Arabian Adventures offers dozens of tours around Dubai and the rest of the Emirates, but it is arguably most famous for its organised excursions into the desert. There are all sorts of safari adventures to choose from, with prices starting at AED285 (€70). These take visitors to various areas of the desert at different times of day – from sunrise to sunset – and with a selection of activities included, such as dune and wildlife drives to barbecues at a Bedouin-style camp. This is a particularly great option for first-timers to the UAE.</p></div>

			<h2>Dubai Creek: Discover a lost Arabian world</h2>
			<p>Dubai Creek flows through the Emirates historic heart. For just one dirham, abra rides provide boatloads of nostalgia while travelling between the souks and museums of Deira and Bur Dubai.
			These heritage hubs recall the Bedouins’ humble and ancient past built on pearls, and then shaped by a free trade boom that brought new settlers to the creek in the early 1900’s.
			Echoing that era, today’s expats – some descendants of those early traders – share authentic flavours from their homelands in a culinary kaleidoscope that compliments Emirati fare.</p></div>

			<h2>Greek tourism hit hard by cancellations amid coronavirus outbreak</h2>
			<p>Take century upon century of empires jostling for supremacy at sea and ships sailing into exotic ports fringed by fortresses and temples of stone and set all this against the backdrop of a shimmering blue sea, and you may well start to fall under the eternal spell of the Greek islands. The archipelago is varied and vast, and Greece's rich seafaring past means that from Corfu to Crete by way of Mykonos, Patmos, Karpathos and many more there is a veritable tapestry of history and culture to discover.</p></div>

			<h2>How to find your inner Athenian</h2>
			<p>If the monuments of the bustling Greek capital are instantly recognizable as Athenian—think Parthenon, ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus theater and Panathenaic Stadium—tuning in to the unique rhythms of Athens is a slightly different kind of exercise. With some three and half millennia behind it, you might think that Athens is only defined by its past but that's only part of the story: this is a modern and multifaceted Mediterranean metropolis. So, yes to captivating ruins and cozy Greek tavernas around Plaka, but you'll also find sizzling rooftop bars, buzzing cafes and just a few minutes' stroll from ancient temples, street art so vibrant it practically leaps from the walls.</p></div>
